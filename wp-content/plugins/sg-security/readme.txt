Unveil the vast array of features and unleash the full potential of our security plugin in our [Security Optimizer Tutorial](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/sg-security/).

== SITE PROTECTION FEATURES ==

Safeguard your WordPress application using our powerful site security toolset. Our comprehensive features are specifically designed to strengthen your website's defenses against malware, exploits, and various malicious activities. With these tools at your disposal, you can ensure the utmost bot, malware and brute force protection for your website:

= Lock and Protect System Folders =

Ensure the maximum security for your application's system folders by preventing the execution of any unauthorized or malicious scripts. The Lock and Protect System Folders feature acts as a powerful shield against potential threats.

= Hide WordPress Version =
Protect your website from mass attacks by hiding the WordPress version, which helps to mitigate version-specific vulnerabilities.

= Disable Themes & Plugins Editor =

Enhance the security of your WordPress admin area by disabling the Themes & Plugins Editor, preventing potential coding errors and unauthorized access through the editor.

= Disable XML-RPC =

Mitigate potential security risks by disabling the XML-RPC protocol, which has been exploited in various attacks. Please note that disabling XML-RPC will restrict WordPress from communicating with third-party systems. We recommend enabling this feature unless you have a specific need for it.

= Disable RSS and ATOM Feeds =

Prevent content scraping and specific attacks on your site by disabling RSS and ATOM feeds. Unless you have readers accessing your site via RSS readers, it is recommended to keep this feature enabled.

= Advanced XSS Protection =

Add an extra layer of website security against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by enabling Advanced XSS Protection, bolstering the overall security of your website.

= Delete Default Readme.html =

Eliminate potential vulnerabilities by deleting the default readme.txt file, which contains information about your website. By removing this file, you reduce the risk of your site being listed in vulnerable sites targeted by hackers.

== Login Security ==

= Custom Login Url =

Personalize your login URL to thwart potential attacks and create a strong entry point. Bid farewell to the default login URL and embrace a bespoke path of your choosing. Additionally, you have the freedom to modify the default sign-up URL as well.

= Login Access =

Restrict login page access to specific IP addresses or IP ranges, effectively thwarting malicious login attempts and deterring brute force attacks.

= 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) =

Immerse your website in an impenetrable shield of security with 2FA. This formidable feature demands that all admin users furnish a unique token, generated exclusively through the Google Authentication application, during the login process.

= Disable Common Usernames =

Don't fall victim to predictable security breaches! The use of common usernames, such as 'admin,' poses a significant threat to the integrity of your website. Activate this option to disable the creation of common usernames. If any weak usernames already exist, we'll prompt you to provide new, stronger alternatives.

= Limit Login Attempts =

Maintain control over unauthorized access attempts with Limit Login Attempts. Set a specific threshold for the number of login failures users can endure before consequences arise. After reaching the limit, the IP address associated with the unsuccessful login attempts will be blocked for one hour. Persistent failures will result in longer restrictions, starting with 24 hours and escalating to a week.

== ACTIVITY MONITORING ==

Monitor your website and login page for unauthorized visitors and brute force attempts to prevent malicious actions

= Activity Log =

The Activity Log page provides you with a comprehensive view of the activities performed by registered, unknown, and blocked visitors. It allows you to closely monitor any suspicious behavior and take appropriate actions in case of a compromised user, plugin, or hacking attempt. You can leverage the quick tools available to swiftly block future attempts.

= Weekly Security Reports =

Receive a weekly traffic summary for your website directly to your inbox. This **Weekly Security Report** compiles data on both bot and human traffic, along with details about blocked login and visit attempts to proactively monitor traffic and promptly identify suspicious activity.

== POST-HACK ACTIONS ==
Take immediate measures to protect your website if you suspect a compromise and prevent further damage. Here, you'll find convenient solutions to address the situation effectively:

= Reinstall All Free Plugins =

In the event of a hack, utilizing the Reinstall All Free Plugins feature can help mitigate potential harm. This action reinstalls all of your free plugins, reducing the likelihood of additional exploits or the reuse of malicious code.

= Log Out All Users =

To prevent any further unauthorized activities by users or attackers, you can choose to log out all users instantly using the Log Out All Users feature.

= Force Password Reset =

By enforcing a password reset, you can ensure that all users are prompted to change their passwords during their next login. This not only strengthens the security of their accounts but also immediately logs out all currently logged-in users.

## Data Collection ##

Collection of technical data is optional and is [listed here](https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-information-wp-plugins-collect). This data is collected only for technical analysis, improvements and the possibility to contact the plugin user in case urgent issues need to be fixed (for example a critical security release that needs to be communicated to site owners). The plugin user can manage their preferences within the WP admin to control the collection of technical data. We advise opting in for this data collection, as it can enhance the plugin's performance. You may find more information on data collection in our [Plugins Privacy Notice](https://www.siteground.com/viewtos/siteground_plugins_privacy_notice).
