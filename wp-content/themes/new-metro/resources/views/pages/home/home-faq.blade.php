            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p class="faq-text">At NewMetro, we want to work with folks that want to work with us. Therefore, we don’t send out blind offers. However, if we mutually decide to work together, we will set the price and terms together. From there, we will move forward as partners instead of just having a transactional relationship.</p>
