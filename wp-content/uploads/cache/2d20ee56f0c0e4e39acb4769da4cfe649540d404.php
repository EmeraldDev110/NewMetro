            <h2 class="faq-question">Can I request a blind offer?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p class="faq-text">At NewMetro, we want to ensure people really enjoy working with us. Therefore, we don’t send out blind offers. However, if we mutually decide to collaborate, we will set the price and terms together. From there, we will move forward as partners instead of just having a transactional relationship.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-question">This offer sounds too good to be true. 
            <div id="spacing"> </div> What’s the deal?</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p class="faq-text">There’s no hidden catch or agenda. We understand that some agents tend to represent the property-selling process as far more complicated than it really is. Moreover, they rarely treat clients as human beings. For many agents, making a profit is the only goal.</p>
                <p class="faq-text">Our mission is to show that there’s a better way than that. We want to secure fair cash offers and hassle-free transaction processes for the people we collaborate with.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-question">How do we sign documents?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p class="faq-text">We aim to ensure a frictionless process for signing documents, treating you the way we would want to be treated. We utilize DocuSign for the initial agreement. Following this, we arrange for a mobile notary to meet you at your preferred location to sign the closing documents. Once signed, the notary returns everything to the closing attorney. After the property and the deed are recorded, the closing attorney finalizes the transaction by sending you your check. Rest assured, our goal is to make this process as smooth and stress-free as possible for you.</p>
